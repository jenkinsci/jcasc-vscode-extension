## What does the plugin do 
This plugin deals with the authentication and fetching of the JSON schema from a live Jenkins instance.
It provides the base for validation of yaml files written to configure a Jenkins instance.

## How to use

- Download and install the plugin from the VSCode Marketplace.
- Inside the Settings tab of VSCode find JCasc which will display two input blocks:

    - URL field for the Jenkins instance that you want to to extract the YAML Schema from.

    - User Token Field for if the Jenkins instance is protected.
- Once this is set you can use `Ctrl + Shift + P` to bring up the dialog box and then select the JCasC extension from the list of extensions, this will activate the extension.
- This will download the schema with the filename `jcasc-schema.json` to the current working directory.
- This schema file can then be used to autosuggest and validate the yaml file written for JCasC.

## User Guide

In order to enable validation we need to include it in the workspace settings. In order to do that
navigate to `File` and then `Preference` and then `Settings`. Inside settings search for `json` and inside `settings.json` include the following configuration.

```yaml
{
"yaml.schemas": {
        "schema.json": "y[a]?ml"
    }
}
```

You can specify a glob pattern as the value for schema.json which is the file name for the schema. This would apply the schema to all yaml files. eg: `.[y[a]?ml]`

The following tasks can be done using VSCode:

  a) Auto completion (Ctrl + Space):
    Auto completes on all commands.

  b) Document Outlining (Ctrl + Shift + O):
  Provides the document outlining of all completed nodes in the file.

 Create a new file under the work directory called `jenkins.yml`. For example consider the following contents for the file:

```yaml
jenkins:
  systemMessage: “Hello World”
  numExecutors:2
```

 The above yaml file is valid according to the schema and vscode should provide you with validation and autocompletion for the same.
